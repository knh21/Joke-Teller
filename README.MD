# Joke-Teller
This a spin on an earlier project I did with the jokes API, but now I've added a nice little robot gif and I've used a text-to-speech api. When you click the button a nice robot tells you a (sometimes) funny joke.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jokes API and Text-To-Speech

I made this with just html. css and javascript. I took from what i learned about apis and put my own spin on it while learning about how to put in a text to speech functionality in it as well.
